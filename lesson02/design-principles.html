                            One of the reason why I chose Apple for having a website with white space and with a clean design
                            is because when you look at Apple's website, the margins surrounding the images and cards are wide.
                            Utlizing white space for their website helps organize their content they are sharing and it helps
                            with the readability for the user to understand.

                        <p>
                            Hubspot's websites utilizes the user of rule of thirds by focusing the important content on the points
                            where the grid intersects. If you were to put a 3x3 grid over the image, you can see that the where the
                            four points interests at - close to the center of the picture - you can see that the user will see their
                            motto and an image of the weekly activity.

                        <p>
                            Codecademy's website is a good prime example of using contrast. In their website, you can see the two 
                            colors, purple and yellow. The difference in colors helps the content of the website stick and stand
                            out. Not only does it help the content of the website stick out, but depending of the color text, it
                            also makes the text more eligible.
